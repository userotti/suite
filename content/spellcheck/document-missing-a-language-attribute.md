By including the `lang` attribute at the root of your HTML page, user agents (including the Passmarked web crawler) will be able to interpret the natural language used throughout your web application.
If this attribute is left unspecified, Passmarked cannot determine which language must be used for spellchecking. 

As an aside, the `lang` attribute is, in fact, a global attribute. This means it can be added to any element in a document.
Web applications that have been heavily internationalised may rely on this property of the `lang` attribute and pepper it heavily across a document employing different values.
Like any other attribute available in HTML, it can be selected in CSS. This could allow you, as a developer, to style languages differently throughout a document or application.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

# How do I fix this ?

Simply add the `lang` attribute and the two-letter code for your locale as the attribute value to the root `html` tag in your documents.
